### Don't be the slowest player

Evaluate your pace of play honestly and often, and if you're consistently the slowest one in your group, you're a slow player, period. Encourage everyone to move quickly enough so you find yourself right behind the group in front several times, both early and late in the round.

### Be a Silent and Still partner

Do not talk. Even whispering is distracting. Also, moving, fidgeting and worst of all making practice swings in someones field of vision as they are getting ready to hit a shot is distracting. The point is, stand still from the time a player sets himself until the ball has left the club.

### Keep your temper under control

### Repair the ground you play on

No one wants to play out of a divot or a shoe print in the sand.

### Make your golf cart 'invisible'

Park the cart behind the player and out of the field of vision. Shut the cart off and be still until the player has hit.

### Turn off the cell phone

Nobody knows less about technology than I do. But I know enough to recognize a cell phone when it rings in my backswing. If I had my way, cell phones would be turned off at all times on the course, but most clubs have given in to the fact that people are going to use them. I don't know all the gadgets and settings on those phones, but do whatever you have to do to keep it quiet. And if you absolutely have to make a call, move away from the other players. And keep the call so brief that they don't even know you made it.

### Lend a hand when you can

It's easy to help out your fellow players, if you just pay attention. One obvious way is looking for lost balls -- better yet, watching errant shots so they don't turn into lost balls. Pick up that extra club left on the fringe or the headcover dropped next to the tee, and return it to its owner after saying, "Nice shot!" And if you see a cart out of position or a provisional ball that needs picking up. Don't just walk by.

### Learn the little things

There are a hundred bits of etiquette I haven't mentioned, like laying the flagstick down carefully, tamping down spike marks when you're walking off a green, letting faster groups play through, and so on. All of these things are learned by observing, with a sharp eye and a considerate heart. Just know that golf has a way of returning favors, and every piece of etiquette you practice will be repaid tenfold.
