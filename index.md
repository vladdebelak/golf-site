### Welcome
<br/>
The Albuquerque Seniors Golf Association invites you to join us.

The Albuquerque seniors is basically a golf league governed by an elected board of directors to sponsor senior (>50) recreational golf tournaments. We are open to men and women. We play once a month, typically during the third week from Feb - Oct. including a three round championship. We play courses in the Albuquerque area including Santa Fe, Cochiti, Canyon Club, Socorro, UNM, Twin Warriors, Santa Ana, Desert Greens, ADO, Isleta, etc. We do not  have any overnight tournaments. Click on the forms tab to view and print. Mail the membership form with the dues to the P.O. Box on the form and we will contact you. Membership dues are only $25.00. All tournaments are $60. An established handicap is not required.
On our site also view tournament schedules and results of tournaments played.
