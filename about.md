The Albuquerque Seniors Golf Association plays 11 Tournaments each year in the general Albuquerque area including a year end championship. Some courses we play are Belen, Santa Fe, Grants, Socorro, Twin Warriors, Santa Ana, Isleta, Cochiti, Desert Greens, UNM, Kirkland AFB, etc. None of these tournaments require an over night stay.

Our tournament play starts in February and extends through October. An established handicap is not required. See Schedule.

We encourage our participants to play by the rules of USGA, as far as possible but, as we don't have judges during the tournament we must police ourselves and playing partners. Your playing partners must be consulted on where to drop, if a ball is lost (LB), out of bounds (OB), or unplayable lie. If a dispute arises, a provisional ball may be played and the problem can be reviewed by the local pro shop or the Board of Directors.

We award points for tournament winners and also five points for closest to the pin on the par 3 holes in each tournament.

The three Championship tournaments are included in these 11 Tournaments and are played over a two week period in September or October.

We have a free awards luncheon in early November or December for points settlement, tournament day money, (usually over 50% of players Win), and a raffle for any gifts or certificates from the various golf courses that award these prizes during the year.
